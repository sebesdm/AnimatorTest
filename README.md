# AnimatorTest

The models used here are from the Synty SimplePeople2 pack, which is the source of the avatar (SimplePeople2Avatar) and animator controller (SimpleCharacter_5.0).  The animator controller is using a Mixamo animation (SimpleCitizens_NewRig@Reaction).

SetupAnimatorsOnModels GameObject/script fetches the 3 GameObjects having the Character component on them and adds a new Animator to each and sets the shared avatar and controller.
